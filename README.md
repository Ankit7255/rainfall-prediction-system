# Rainfall Prediction System

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict rainfall based on weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. The model has been optimized through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance accuracy.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training with multiple classifiers
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy
- Evaluation using classification metrics
- Prediction on unseen data

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- XGBoost, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rainfall-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd rainfall-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```sh
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Train the model:
   ```sh
   python train.py
   ```
3. Make predictions:
   ```sh
   python predict.py
   ```

## Results
The best-performing model achieved high accuracy in rainfall prediction after hyperparameter tuning. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
