# rainfall-prediction-system
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict rainfall based on weather parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model tuning, and evaluation. Various classifiers were tested, and the best-performing model was selected for accurate predictions.
